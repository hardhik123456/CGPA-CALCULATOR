# CGPA Calculator

## Brief Description
The **CGPA Calculator** is a simple tool designed to help students calculate their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on their individual course grades. It automates the process of CGPA calculation by taking course credits and corresponding grade points as input. This tool is useful for students to quickly assess their academic performance and track their progress throughout their academic journey.

## Features
- Allows input of multiple courses with different credit hours and grade points.
- Automatically calculates the CGPA based on the provided data.
- Provides clear and accurate results.
- Can be customized to fit different grading systems (e.g., 4.0, 10-point, etc.).

## How It Works
1. Input the **number of courses** you have taken in a semester.
2. For each course, input the **credit hours** and the corresponding **grade point** you received.
3. The tool will calculate the CGPA using the formula:

   \[
   \text{CGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Credit Hours} \times \text{Grade Points})}{\sum \text{Credit Hours}}
   \]

4. The final CGPA will be displayed.
